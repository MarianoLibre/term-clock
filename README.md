# Shell clock

A clock app that runs on your terminal.

Fuck! I should've name it _terminal clock_ ðŸ˜…...

## Why?

I wanted a timer that I can run in the terminal 'cause I work on the terminal all the time.

## What?

I wrote a quick sketch in **BASH** using **Figlet** fonts and it looked good, but it flickers from time to time because I needed to clear the screen too often.

With that initial idea in mind, I realized I could write a nice app using ncurses with Python/Lua/C[++].

Since I'm learning Go and Rust, maybe I'll give them a try too.

## I'm sorry... What?

Time permitting, I want to write the clock/timer app in [some of] those languages. But since it's essentially the same app, I'm going to put everything here.
